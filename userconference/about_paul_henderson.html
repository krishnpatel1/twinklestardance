                    <h5>About Paul Henderson</h5>
                    <p>Paul Henderson has been around the dance industry for over thirty years. His sisters were elite state champion gymnasts and dancers and his mother owned a dance studio and eventually a dancewear store. He managed the dancewear store for a few years before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area. He and his wife, Tiffany currently own and operate eight successful dance studios in Northern California and one in Southern California. Their annual enrollment of over 4500 students forced Paul to automate most of the day-to-day business transactions that take up so much of a studio owner/instructor's time.</p> 
                    <p>Paul's goal has always been to smooth out the business side of the dance studios so that his wife, Tiffany can spend more time in the studio doing what she loves...teaching.</p>
                    <p>Automating online registration and monthly automatic tuition payments was achieved 7 or 8 years ago but perhaps the most revolutionary invention is his web-based application - CostumeManager.com.</p>
                    <h5>About Storefront and CostumeManager.com</h5>
                    <p>For the past six years Paul has worked tirelessly with most of the major costume and dancewear manufacturers to consolidate their catalogs into one searchable website. Developing relationships with these companies has been crucial to the success of CostumeManager.com and his efforts have paid off for studios all across the United States and Canada.</p>
                    <p>By creating one searchable website, it is possible for a studio owner to browse all catalogs simultaneously, assign items that they like to a dance class, establish their profit margin, print a color worksheet for dancers explaining how they can order their required and or/optional items online or via toll free telephone. Dancers purchase their items securely online and CostumeManager.com orders, receives, sorts and ships the individually packaged items to the studio owner. The studio owner or instructor cashes their "commission" check, hands the bags of goods to the dancer and goes back to teaching.</p>
                   <p>CostumeManager.com eliminates 90% of the work and all the worry associated with distributing costumes and dancewear to dancers while preserving all of the profit marginâ€¦if not more.</p>
                   <p>Dance More, Work Less!</p>
